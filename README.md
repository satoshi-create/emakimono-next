# 🎐 Emakimono: Horizontal Scroll Picture Scroll Viewer

This project reimagines traditional Japanese picture scrolls (emakimono) as a horizontally scrollable web experience.  
It allows users to explore narrative scenes by scrolling sideways, simulating the act of reading a physical emaki in a modern browser.

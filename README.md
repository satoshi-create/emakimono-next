> **“Making every emakimono scroll interactively explorable.”**

This project reimagines traditional Japanese picture scrolls (emaki) as interactive digital experiences.  
It brings together frontend technology, storytelling, and cultural heritage — in an open, collaborative spirit.

## 🧭 How to Explore the Scroll

- The scroll proceeds **left to right**, just like traditional emakimono.
- On smartphones: swipe with your finger.  
  On desktop: use trackpad or `shift + scroll` to move horizontally.
- Navigation buttons and thumbnail previews help you jump between scenes.
- Even if you don’t read Japanese, **feel free to interpret the imagery** intuitively!

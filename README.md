# 🎐 Emakimono: Horizontal Scroll Picture Scroll Viewer

This project reimagines traditional Japanese picture scrolls (emakimono) as a horizontally scrollable web experience.  
It allows users to explore narrative scenes by scrolling sideways, simulating the act of reading a physical emaki in a modern browser.

- Let the story unfold slowly — it’s meant to be experienced, not rushed.
- You can use navigation buttons or thumbnails to jump between scenes.
- Even if you're not familiar with Japanese culture, enjoy freely by interpreting the visuals!

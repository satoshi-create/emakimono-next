### 🧭 How to Explore the Scroll

- The emaki scroll proceeds from left to right.
- On smartphones: swipe with your finger.  
  On desktop: use trackpad or shift + mouse wheel to scroll horizontally.
- Let the story unfold slowly — it’s meant to be experienced, not rushed.
- You can use navigation buttons or thumbnails to jump between scenes.
- Even if you're not familiar with Japanese culture, enjoy freely by interpreting the visuals!
